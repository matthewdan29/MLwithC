KRR combines linear ridge regression with the kernel trick and can be used for classification problems. 
It learns a linear funciton in the higher-dimensional space produced by the chosen kernel and training data. 
For non-linear kernels, it learns a non-linear function in the original space. 

The model learned by KRR is identical to the SVM model, but these approaches have the following differences: 

		1) The KRR method uses squared error loss, while the SVM model uses insensitive loss or hinge loss for classification. 

		2) In constrast to the SVM mehthod, the KRR training can be completed in the closed-form so that it can be trained faster from medium-sized datasets. 

		3) The learned KRR model is non-sparse and can be slower than the SVM model when it comes to prediction times.
