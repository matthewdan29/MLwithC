Logistic regression determines the degree of dependence between the categorical dependent and one or more independent variables by using the logistic function. 
It aims to find the calues of the coefficients for the input variables, as with linear regression. 
The difference, in the case of logistic regression, is that the output value is converted by using a non-linear function. 
The logistic function essentially looks like a big letter 'S' and converts any value to a number in a range from 0 to 1. 
This property is useful because we can apply the rule to the output of the logistic function to bind 0 and 1 to a class prediction. 

For example, if the result of the function is less than 0.5 then the output is 0. 
Predition is not just a simple answer either, and we can interpret it as probability of being classified as +1.

In many tasks, this interpretation is an essential business requirement. 
In the task of credit scoring, where logistic regression is traditionally used, the probaility of a loan being defaulted on is a common prediction. 
As with the case of linear regression, logistic regression performs the task better if outliers and correlating variables are removed. 
The logistic regression model can be quickly trained and is well suited for binary classification problems
