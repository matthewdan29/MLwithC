To begin training, we need to configure a dataset object first. 
The mini-batch size can be automatically configured when we define the dataset object. 
This happens when we create the "RegressionDataset" type object. 
To perform one training step, we should use the "step" method of the optimizer object, but we should be aware that this method does only one pass of mini-batch training. 
So, to perform several epochs using the whole dataset, we have to manually caluclate the number steps. 

When training is done, we have to copy the trained parameters from the optimizer obect to the network object. 
This can be done with the "setParameterVector" method of the network object. 
We can use the "solution()" method to get parameters from the optimeizer.
