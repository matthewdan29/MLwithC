The idea of the algorithm is based on the use of the output error of a neural network. 
At each iteration of the algorithm, there are two network passes forward nd backward. 
On a forward pass, an input vector is propagated from the network inputs to its outputs and forms a specific output vector correcsponding to the current propagates from the network output to its inputs, and the neuron weights are corrected. 
In practice, training is continued not until the network is precisely tuned to the minimum of the error function, but until a sufficiently accurate approximation is achieved. 
This process allows us to reduce the number of learning iterations and prevent the network from overfitting.
