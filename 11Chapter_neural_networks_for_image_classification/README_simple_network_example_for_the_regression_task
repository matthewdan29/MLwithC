Let's learn how to use the "Shogun", "Dlib", and "Shark-ML" libraries to create a simple MLP for a regression task. 
The task is the same for all series samples MLP shoud learn cosine function at limited intervals. 
In this books code samples, we can find the full program for the data generation and MLP training. 
Here, we'll discuss the essintial parts of the program (I know this repo looks bad right now and I'm going to fix it after I complete everything so you can read and experament with the algo's) that are used for the nueral networks API view. 
Note that the activation functions we'll be using for these samples are the Tanh and ReLU functions. 
We've chosen them in order to achieve better convergence for this particular task.
