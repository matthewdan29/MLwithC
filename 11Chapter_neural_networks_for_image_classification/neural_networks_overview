This is how artificial neurons work and how they relate to their biological analogs. 
A nueral network is a sequence of neurons interconnected by synapses. 
The structure of the neural network come into the world of programming directly from biology. 
Thanks to this structure, the computer has the ability to analyze and even remember information. 
Neural networks are based on the human brain, which contains millions of neurons that transmit information in the form of electrical impulses.

Artificial neural networks are inspired by biology because they are composed of elements with similar functionalities to thos of biological neurons. 
These elements can be organized in the way that corresponds tothe anatomy of the brain, and they demonstrate a large number of properties that are inherent in the brain. 
They can learn from experience, generalze previous precedents to new cases, and identify significant features from input data that contain redundant information.
