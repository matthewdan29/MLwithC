After we've defined the netwrok structure, we need to define the loss function for the optimization algorithm. 
The "ErrorFunction" class is used for this purpose. 
Its constructor take 4 parameters: 

	1) An object representing the traing dataset 

	2) a pointer to the object that represents the network's structure 

	3) A pointer to the object that implements the loss function "SquraedLoss", in our case. 

	4) A Boolean flag telling us to use mini-batches or not

The "ErrorFunction" type object can be configured with a regularized.
