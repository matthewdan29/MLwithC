The network is developed from a small number of of low-level filters in the initial stages to a vast number of filters, each of which finds a specific high-level attribute. 
The transition from level to level provides a hierarchy of pattern recognition. 

One of the first convolutional network architectures that was successfully applied to the pattern recognition task was the LeNet-5, which was developed by Yann LeCun, Leon Bottou, Yoshuha Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. 
It was used to recognize handwritten and printed numbers in the 1990s. 
We can see that the depth was increasing and that the size become smaller. 
This means that toward the final layer, the number of features the network can learn increased, but their size became smaller. 
Such behavior is very common among different convolutional network architectures.
