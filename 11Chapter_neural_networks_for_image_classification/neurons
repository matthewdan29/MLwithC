The artificial neuron receives a specific set of signals as input, each of which is the output of another neuron. 
Each input is multiplied by the corresponding weight, which is the equivalent to its synaptic power. 
Than, all the products are summed up and the result of this summation is used to determine the level of neuron activation.
