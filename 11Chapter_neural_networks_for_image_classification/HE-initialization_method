The HE initialization method is a variation of the Xavier method thats more suitable for ReLU activation functions because it compensates for the fact that this function returns zero for half of the definition domain. 
This method of weight calculation relies on a probability distribution with the following variance: 
Var(W) = 2 / (N(in))
There are also other methods of weights initialization. 
Which one you choose is usually determinded by the problem being solved, the network topology, the activation functions being used, and the loss function.
