The classical implementation of the algorithm is based on the principle of k-nearest neighbors (kNN). 
For every user, we look for the k most similar to them. 
Then, we supplement the information about the user with known data from their neighbors. 
If it is known that your neighbors are delighted with a movie and you have not watched it for some reason, this is a good reason to recommend this movie. 

An interesting development in the collaborative approach is trust-based recommendations, which take into account not only the proximity of people according to their interests, but also their social proximity and the degree of trust between them, 
For example we see that on Facebook, a girl occasionally vistis a page that has her friend's audio recordings, then she trusts her musical taste. 
Therfore, when making recommendations to the girl, you can add new songs from her friends's playlist.
