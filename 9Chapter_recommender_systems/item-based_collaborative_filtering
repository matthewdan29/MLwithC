For each client, a user-based collaborative filtering system searches a group of customers who are similar to this user in terms of previous purchases, and then the system averages their perferences. 
These average preferences serve as recommendations for the user. 
IN the case of item based collaborative filtering, the nearest neighbors are searched for on a variety of products columns of a preference matrix and the average occurs precisely according to them. 

If some products are meaningfully similar to each other, then users' reactions to these products will be the same. 
Therefore, when we see that some products have a strong correlation between their estimates, this may indicate that these products are equivalent to each other.
The main advantage of the item-based approach over the user-based approach is lower computation complexity. 
Estimation of the proximity of products is much more accurate than the assessment of the proximity of users.
