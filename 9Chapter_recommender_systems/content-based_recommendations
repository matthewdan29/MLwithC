Personal recommendations use the maximum information available about the user primarily, information on their pervious purchases. 
Content based filetering was one of the first approaches to this. 
The product's description (content) is compared with the interests of the user, obtained from their pervious assessments. 
The more the product meets these interests, the high the potential interest of the user. 
The ovious requirement here is that all products in the catalog should have a description.
