Cosine distance is another classic measuring factor. 
If you look closely, the cosine of the angle between the standardized vectors is Pearson's correlation, the same formula. 
This distance uses cosine properties: if the two vectors are co-directed then the cosine of the angle between them is 1. 
Conversely, the cosine of the angle between perpendicular vectors is 0.
