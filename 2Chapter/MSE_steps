		The following describes MSE steps: 

	1) Initialize "X" with zeros
	
	2) Define a value for the learning rate parameter that controls how much we ar adjusting parameters during the learning procedure. 
	
	3) Calculate the following values of "X": 

	4) Repeat steps 1-3 for a number of times or until the MSE value reaches a reasonable amout. 

Most ML algo's have this linear regression concepts.
