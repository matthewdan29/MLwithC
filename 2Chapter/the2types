Internal parameters have the following characteristics

	1) They are necessary for making predictions 

	2) they define the quality of the model on the given problem 

	3) we can learn them from training data. 

	4) Usually they are a part of the model 

Internal parameter are as follows: 

	1) weights of artificial neural networks (ANNs)

	2) Support vector values for SVM models 

	3) Polynomial coefficients for linear regression or logictic regression



On the other hand hyperparameters have the following 

	1) They are used to configure algorithms that estimate model parameters

	2) They practitioner usually specifies them. 

	3) Their estimation is often based on using heuristics 

	4) They are specific to a concrete modeling problem 


Examples of hyperparameters are as follows 

	1) C and sigma parameters used in the SVM algorithm for a classification quality configuration

	2) The learning rate parameter that is used in the neural network training process to configure algorithm convergence. 

	3) The k value that is used in the KNN algorithm to configure the numerber of neighbors.
