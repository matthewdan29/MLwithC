Supervised ML algorithms usually take a limited set of labled data and build models that can make reasonable predictions for new data. 

	1)Classification models predict some finite and distinct types of categories this could be a label that identifies if an email is spam or not, whether an image contains a human face or not. 

	2) Regression models predict continuous reponses such as change in temperature or calues of currency exchange rates. 
	Regression models are applied to algorithmic trading, forcasting of electricity load, revunue prediction, and other.
