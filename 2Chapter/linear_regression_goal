The goal of the linear regression task is to find parameters vectors that satisfy the previoud equation. 
There is no exact solution to such a system of linear equations, so the task is to estimate parameters that satisfy these equations with some assumptions. 
One of the most popular estimations approaches is one based on the principle of least squares: minimizing the sum of the squares of the differencence between the observed dependent variable in the given dataset and those predicted by the linear function. 
This is called the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator.
