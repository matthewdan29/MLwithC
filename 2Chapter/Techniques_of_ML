	1) Supervised learning is an approach based on the use of labeled data. 
	  Labeled data is a set of known data samples with corresponding known target outputs. 
	 Such as a kind of data is used to build a model that can predict future outputs. 

	2) Unsupervised learning is a approach that does not require labeled data and can search hidden aptterns and structures in an arbitrary kind of data.
