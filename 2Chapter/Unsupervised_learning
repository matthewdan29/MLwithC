Unsupervised learning algorithms do not use labeled datasets. 
They create models that use intrinsic relations in data to find hidden patterns that they can use for making predictions. 
The mose well known unsupervised learning techneque is clustering. 
Clustering is applied in market researches, different types of analysis, DNA analysis, image segmentation, and object detection. 
typical algorithms for creating models for performing clustering are k-means, k-medoids, Gaussion mixture models, hierarchial clustering, and hidden Markov models.
