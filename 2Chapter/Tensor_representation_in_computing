There are two standard practices to orgainze tensors with a linear array in memory: row-major ordering and column-major ordering. 

	1) Row-Major ordering - We place consecutive elements of a row in linear order one after the other, and each row is also placed after the end of the previous one. 

	2) Column-Major ordering - We do the same but with the column elements. 
	  

Data layouts have a significant impact on computational performance because the speed of traversing an array relies on modern CPU architectures that work with sequential data more efficiently that with non-sequential data.
