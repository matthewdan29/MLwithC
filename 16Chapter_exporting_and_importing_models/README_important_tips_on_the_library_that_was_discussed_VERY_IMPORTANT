The "Shogun toolkit" can lead neural network architectures from the JSON descritions, but can't export them. 
The "Dlib" library can export neural networks in XML format but can't load them.
The "Pytorch" C++ API lacks a model architecture that supports exporting, but it can lead and evaluate model architectures that have been exported from the Python API with its TorchScript functionality. 
However, the "PyTorch" library does provide access to the Caffe2 library API, which allows us to load an devaluate models saved in ONNX format from C++.
