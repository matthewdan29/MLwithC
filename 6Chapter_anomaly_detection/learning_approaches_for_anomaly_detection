	Below are straghtforward methods we can use for anomaly detection. 

		1) Detectiong anomalies with statistical tests 
			A) Statistical tests are usually used to catch extreme values for individual features. 
Z-score measure is a well know test. 

		2) Detecting anomalies with the local outliner factor method 
			A) These methods assume that there is a specific metice in the object space that helps us fine anomalies. 
The general assumption when we use distance-based methods for anomaly detection is that the anomaly only has a few neighbors, while a normal point has many. 

		3) Detecting anomalies with isolation forest
			A) A random partitioning of the feature space is carried out so that, on average, isolated points are cut off from normal ones. 
The final result is averaged over several runs of the stochastic algorithm, and the result will from an isolation forest of correspoinding trees. 
The isolation tree algorithm then builds a random binary decision tree. 
The root of the tree is the whole feature space. 

		4) Detecting anomalies with One-Class SVM (OCSVM)
			A)The support vector method is a bindary classification method beased on using a hyperplaen to divide objects into classes. 
The dimensions of the hyperplane are always chosen so that they're less than the dimensions of the original space. 
OCSVM is an abdaption of the support vector method that focuses on anomaly detection. 
The resulting optimization problem includes an improvment for dtermining a small perventagge of predetermined anomalous values, which allows this method to be used to detect anomalies. 
These anomalous values lie between the starting point and the optimal separating hyperplane. 
All other data belonging tho the same class falls on the opposite side of the optimal separating hyperplane.
