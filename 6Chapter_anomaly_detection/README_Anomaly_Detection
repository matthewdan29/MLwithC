Anomaly detection is where we search for unexpected values in a given dataset. 
An anomaly is a system behavior deviation or data value deviation from the standard value. 
There are other names for anomalies such as outliers, errors, deviations, and exceptions. 
They can occur in data that's of deiverse nature and structure as a result of technical failures, accidents, deliberate hacks, and more.
