To perform the sorting operation, we defined a lambda function that changes the order of the container's items by the given vector of indices.
This was the "appy_permutation" lambda. 
This function created a new intermediate vector of the same size as the one we want to reorder and filled it with the "std::transform" algorithm with a custom functor, which returns the item from the original container but with the index taken from the permutaion object. 

When all the batch vectors have been sorted in the required order, we can use the "torch::stack" function to concatenate each of them into the single tensor with an additional dimenstion.
