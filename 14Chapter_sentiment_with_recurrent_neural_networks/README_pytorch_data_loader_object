The PyTorch data loader object is responsible for sampling random training objects and making batches from them. 
The objects of our "ImdbDataset" class should be initialized with the "ImdbReader" and "Vocabulary" class instances. 
We also added the "device" parameter of "torch::DeviceType" into the constructor to tell the object where to place the training object in CPU or CPU memory. 
In the constructor, we store the pointers to input objects and the device type.
We override two methods from the "torch::data::Dataset" class: the "get" and "size" methods.
