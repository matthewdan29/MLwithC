The "forward" method is also a copy of the same method from the "torch::nn::LSTM" module, but it used a different overload of the "torch::lstm" function. 
We can see that the main logic in the "forward" method is to initialize the cell state if it is not defined and called the "torch::lstm" function. 
Notice that all the methods in this class consider the "options.bidirectional_" flag in order to configure the dimensions of the weights and state tensors. 
Also, notice that the module's state is a combined tensor from two tensors: the hidden state and the cell state.
