To estimate algorithm quality for each classification class, we use 2 metrices

		1) precision = Is proportional to the number of correctly classified items within selected ones. 
Another name for precision is specifiy

		2) recall = is proportional to the number of correctly classified items within all ground truth positive itmes. 
Anoher name for the recall is sensitivity

Assume that we are interseted in the detection of positive items - lets call them relevant ones. 
So, we use the recall value as a measure of an algorithm's ability to detect relevant items and the precision value as a measure of an algorithm's ability to see the differences between classes. 
These measures do not depend on the number of objects in each of the classes, and we can use them for imbalanced dataset classification.
