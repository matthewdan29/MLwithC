Validation is a technique that's used to test model performance. 
It estimates how well the model makes predictions on new data. 
New data is data that we did not use for the training process. 
To perform validation, we usually divide our initial dataset  in two or three parts. 
One part should contain most of the data and will be used for training, while other ones will be used to validate and test the model. 
Usually, validation is performed for iterative algorithms after one training cycle. 
We can perform testing after the overall training process.
