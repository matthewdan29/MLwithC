The bias is a prediction characteristic that tells us about the distance between model predictions and ground truth values. 
Usually, we use the term high bias or underfitting to say that model prediction is to far from the ground truth values, which means that the model generalization ability is weak.
To deal with high bias, we can add more features to the training sample. 
Increasig the polynomial degree for the polynomial regression model adds more features; these all-new features describe the original training sample because each additional polynomial term is based on the original sample value.
