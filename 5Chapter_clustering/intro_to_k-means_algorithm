The k-means algorithm, is proportional to the distance to the cluster center of mass. 
The cluster center of mass is the average value of cluster objects' coordinates in the data space. 
The k-means algorithm can be briefly described with the following steps. 
		1) we select k random objects and define each of thems as a cluster prototype that represents the cluster's center of mass. 
		
		2) then, remaining objects are attached to the cluster with greater similarity. 
		
		3) The center of mass of each cluster is recalculated. 

For each obtained partition a particular evaluation function is calculated, the values of which at each step from a converging series. 
The process continues until the specified series converges to its limit value. 

Basicly moving objects from one cluster to another cluster ends when the clusters remain unchanged. 
Minimizing the evaluation function allows the resulting clusters to be as compact and separate as possible.
