A metric or a distance measure is an essential concept in clustering because it is used to determine the similarity between objects. 
Befor applying a distance measure the objects, we have to make a vector of object charactersitic usually this is a set of numerical values such as height or weight. 
Also, some algorithms can work with categorical objects features. 
The standard prcatice is to normalize features values. 
Normalization ensures that each feature gives the same impact in a distance measure calculation. 
There are many distance measure functions that can be used in the scope of the clustering task. 
The most popular ones used for numerical properties are Euclidean distance, Squared Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and CHebyshev distance.
