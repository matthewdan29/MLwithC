The essence of algorithms based on the graph theory is to represent target objects in graph form. 
Graph vertices correspond to objects, and the edge weights are equal to the diestance between vertices. 
The advantages of graph clustering algorithms are thier excellent visiblity, relative ease of implementation, and thier ability to make various improvements based on geometrical considerations. 
The main algorithms based on graph theory are the algorithm for slelcting connected components, the algorithm for constructing the minium spanning tree, and the multilayer cluster algorithm.
