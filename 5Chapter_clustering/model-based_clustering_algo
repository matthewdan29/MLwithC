Model based algorithms assume that there is a particular mathematical model of the cluster in the data space and try to maximiuze the likelihood of this model and the availale data. 
often, this uses the apparatus of mathematical statistics. 

The EM (Expection-Maximization) algo assumes that the dataset can be modeled using a linear combination of multidimensional normal distributions. 
its purpose is to estimate distribution parameters that maximize the likelihood function used as a measure of model quality. 
It assumes that the data in each cluster obeys a particular distribution law --mostly its normal distribution(This method is very powerful).
