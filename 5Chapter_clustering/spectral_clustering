Spectral clustering refers to all methods that divide a set of data into clusters using the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of a graph or other matrices derived from it. 
Spectral clustering is a transformation of the initial set of objects into a set of cuts problem. 
The resulting set of points in then clustered using the standard methods. 
Changing the representation created by eigenvectors allows us to set the properties of the original set of clusters more clearly.
