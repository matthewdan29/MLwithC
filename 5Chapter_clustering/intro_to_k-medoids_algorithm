To reduce the influence of noise and isolated points on the clustering result, the k-medoids algorithm, in contrast to k-means algorithm, uses on of the cluster objects as the center of cluster. 
As in the k-means method, k representative objects are selected at random. 
Eache of the remaining objects is combined into a cluster with the nearest representative object. 
Then, each representative object is iteratively replaced with an arbitrary unrepresentative object from the data space. 
The replacement process continues until the quality of the reusting clusters improves. 
The clustering quality is determined by the sum of deviations between objects and the representative object of th ecorresponding cluster, which the method tries to minimize. 
Thus, the iteration continue until the representatve object in each of the clustere becomes the mediod. 
A medoid object closest to the center of the cluster. 
The algroithm is poorly scalable for large data. 
Methods like CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based on RANdomized Search) algo which complements the k-mediods method. 
For multidimensional clustering, the PROCLUS (Projected Clustering) algo is constructed.
