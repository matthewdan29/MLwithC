Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method that is used for splitting the original dataset of objects into groups classified by properties. (This has a lot to do with cancer research topic I was working with on a nuero network(ya i know its misspelled but if your able to understand it you in the right place my friend))
An object in ML is usually treated as a point in the multidimensional metric space. 
Every space dimension corresponds to an object property, and the metric is a function of the values of these properties. 
Depending on the types of dimensions in this space, which can be both numerical and categorical, we choose thetype of clustering algo and specific metric function. 
This choice depends on the nature of different objects properties' types. 

	We can split cluster analysis into the following phases: 

	1) Selecting objects for clustering 
	
	2) Determining the set of object properties that we will use for the metric

	3) Normalizing property values 

	4) calculating the metric

	5) Identifying distinct groups of objects based on metric values (DO NOT DO IT WITH COVID 19!!(hey i'm telling you this for your safty))

After the analysis of clustering results, some correction may be required for the selected metric of the chosen algo 

	We can use clustering for various real world tasks like: 
	
	1) Splitting news into several categories for advertisers. 

	2) identifying custromer groups by their preferences for marketing analysis (It gets deeper my guy like if your not in this game you shouldnt be reading this)

	3) Identifying plant and animal groups for biological studies 

	4) Identifying and categorizing properties for city planning and managment

	5) Detecting earthquake epicenter clusters to identfy danger zones

	6) Categorizing group of insurances policyholders for risk management 

	7) categorizing books in libraries 

	8) Searching for hidden structural similarities in the data
