The algorithm for selecting connected components is based on the R input parameter, and the algorithm removes all edges in the graph with distances greater than R. 
Only the closest pair of objects remain connected. 
The algorithm's goal is to find the R value at which the graph collapses into several connected components. 
The resulting components are clusters. 
For the selection fo the R paramters, a histogram of the distribution of pairwise distances is usually constructed. 
For problems with a well defined cluster data structure, there will be two peaks in the histogram: 
			1) one corresponds to in-cluster distances and the second to inter-cluster distances .
	
			2) The R paramter is selected from the minimum zone between these peaks. 

Managing the number of clusters using the distance threshold can be difficult.
