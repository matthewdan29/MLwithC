The partitioin-based methods use a similarty measure to combine objects into groups. 
A practitioner usually selects the similarity measure for such kinds of algorithms by themself, using prior knowledge about a problem of heuristics to select the measure properly. 
Sometimes, several measures need to be tried with the same algo to choose the best one, 
Also, partition based methods usually require either the number of desired clusters or a threshold that regulates the number of output clusters to be explicity specified.
