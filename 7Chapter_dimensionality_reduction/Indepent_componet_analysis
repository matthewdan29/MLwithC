The independent component analysis (ICA) method was proposed as a way to solve the problem of blind signal separation (BSS); that is, selecting independent signals from mixed data. 
Suppose we have two people in the same room who are talking, generating acoustic waves. 
We have two microphones in different parts of the room, recording sound. 
The analysis system receiveds two signals from the two microphones, each of which is a digitized mixture of two acoustic waves -- one from people speaking and one from some other noise. 
Our goal is to select our initial signals from the incoming mixtures. 
Mathematically, the problem represent the incoming mixture in the form of a linear combination, where 'a' represents the displacement coefficients and 'S' represents the values of the vector of indepenent components:

	1) Independent components must be statistically independent. 
Roughly speaking, the values of one vector of an independent compnent do not affect the values of another component. 

	2) Independent components must have a non-Gaussian distribution

The ICA algo performs the following steps: 
	
	1) choose the initial value of 'w' 

	2) Calculate 'w' => E{xg'(w^t*x)} - E{g'(w^t*x)}w, where g(x) = (dG(z))/(dz) is the derivative of the function, G(z). 

	3) Normalizes 'w' => (w)/(||w||)

	4) Repeats the previous two steps until 'w' stops changing
