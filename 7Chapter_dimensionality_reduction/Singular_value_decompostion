Singular value decomposition (SVD) is an important method that's used to analyze data. 
The resulting matrix decomposition has a meaningful interpretation from a ML point of view. 
It can also be used to calcuate PCA. 
SVD is rather slow. 
Therefore, when the matrices are too large, randomized algorithms are used. 
However, the SVD calculation is computationally more efficient than the calculations for the covariance matrix and its eigenvalues in the original PCA approach. 
Therefore, PCA is often implemented in terms of SVD.
