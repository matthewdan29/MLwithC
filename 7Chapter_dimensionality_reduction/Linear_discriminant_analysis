Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a type of multivariate analysis that allows us to estimate differences between two or more groups of objects at the same time. 
The basis of discriminant analysis is the assumption that the descriptions of the objects of each 'K^(th)' class are instances of a multidimensional random variable that's distributed according to the normal law.

LDA algorithm for the case of two classes. 
Lets the discriminant cariables, 'x', be the axes of the 'm'-dimensional Euclidean space. 
Each object is a point of this space with coordinates representing the fixed values of each variable. 
If both classes differ from each other in observable variables, they can be representd as clusters of points in different regions of the considered space that may partially overlap. 
To determine the position of each class, we can calcuate its centroid, which is an imaginary point whose coordinates are the average calues of the cariables in the class. 
The task of discriminant analysis is to create an additional 'z' axis that passes throught a cloud of points in such a way that the projections on it provides the best separability into two classes. 
Its position is given by a linear discriminant function with weights, "Bj", that determine the contribution of each initial variable.
