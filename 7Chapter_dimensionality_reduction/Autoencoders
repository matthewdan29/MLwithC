Autoencoders represent a particular class of neural networks that are configured so that the output of the autoencoder is as close as possible to the input signal. 
In its most straightforward representation, the autoencoder can be modeled as a multilayer perceptron in which the number of neurons in the output layer is equal to the number of inputs.
