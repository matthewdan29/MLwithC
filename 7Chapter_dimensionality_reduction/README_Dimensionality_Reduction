Dimensionality reduction is where you tranfer data that has a higher dimension into a new data representation with a lower dimension, all while preserving the most crucial information from the original data. 
Such a transformation can help us visualize multidimensional space, which can be useful in the data exploration stage or when identifying the most relevant features in dataset samples. 
Some ML techniques can perform better or faster if our data has a smaller number of features since it can consume fewer computational resources. 
The main purpose of this kind of transformation is to save the essential features those features that hold the most critical information present in original data.
