The IsoMap algo is based on the manifold projection technique.
The mainfold is a topological space that locally resembles the Euclidian space near each point. 
The basics of applying manifold projection techniques are to search for a manifold that is close to the data, project the data onto the manifold, and then unfold it. 
The most popular technique that's used to find the manifold is to build a graph based on information about data points. 
Usually, these data points are placed into the graph nodes, and the edges simulate the relationships between the data points. 

The IsoMap algo depends on two parameters: 
	1) The number of neighbors, k, used to search for geodetic distances 
	
	2) the dimension of the final space, m 


In brief, the IsoMap algo follows these steps: 

		1) First, it constructs a graph representing geodesic distances. 
For each point, we search the k nearest neighbors and construct a weight, undirected graph from the distances to these nearest neightbors. 
The edge weight is the Euclidean distance to the neighbor. 

		2) Using an algo to find the shortest distance in the graph, for example, Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to find the shortest distance between each pair of vertices. 
We can consider this distance as a geodesic distance on a manifold. 

		3) based on the matrix of pairwise geodesic distances we obtained in the previous step, train the MDS algo. 

		4) The MDS algorithm associates a set of points in the m-dimensional space with the initial set of distances.
