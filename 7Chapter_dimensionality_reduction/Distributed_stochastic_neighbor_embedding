The stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE) problem is formulated as follws: we have a dataset with points described by a multidimensional varable with a dimension of space substantially high than three. 
It is necessary to obtaion a new variable that exists in a two dimensional or three dimensional space that would maximally preserve the structure and patterens in the original data. 
The difference between t-SNE and the classic SNE lies in the modifications that simplify the process of finding the global minima. 
The main modification is replacing the normal distribution with the students's t-distribution for low dimensional data. 
SNE begins by converting the multidimensional euclidean distance between points into conditional probabilites that reflect the similarity of points. 

Lets imagine that springs connect all the mapping points. 
The stiffness of the string connecting points i and j depends on the difference between the similarity of two points in a multidimensional space and two points in a mapping space. 
In this anaolgy, the gradient is the resultant force that acts on a point in the mapping space. 
If we let the systems go, after some time it results in balance, and this is the desired distribution. 
Algorithmically, it searches for balance while taking the moments into account
