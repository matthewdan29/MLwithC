Factor analysis is used to reduce the number of variables that are used to describe data and determine the relationships between them. 
During the analysis, variables that correlate with each other are combined into one factor. 
As a result, the dispersion between componets is redistributed, and the structure of factors becomes more understnadable. 
After combining the carables, the correlation of components within each factor becomes higher than their correlation with components from other factors. 
It is assumed that known varables depend on a smaller number of unkown variables and that we have a random error that can be expressed. 

The Concept of factor(caribale) load is essential. 
It is used to describe the role of the factor when we wish to form a specific vector from a new basis. 
The essence of factor analysis is the procedure of rotating factors, that is, redistributing the dispersion according to a specific method. 

Dimensionality reduction occurs while transitioning to a system of factors that are representatives of groups, and the other factors are discarded. 
There are several commonly used criteria for determining the number of factors. 
The general factor analysis algorithm follow these steps: 

	1) Calculates the correlation matrix. 
	
	2) Selects the number of factors for inclusion, for example, with the Kaiser criterion. 

	3) Extracts the initial set of factors. 
There are several different extration methods, including maximum likelihood, principal component analysis and principal axis extraction. 

	4) Rotates the factors to a final solution that is equal to the one that was obtained in the initial extration but that has the most straightforward interpreteation.
