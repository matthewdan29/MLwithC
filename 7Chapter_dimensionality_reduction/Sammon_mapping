Sammon mapping is one of the first non linear dimensionality reduction algo. 
In contrast to traditional dimensionality reduction methods, such as PCA, Sammon mapping does not define a data conversion function directly. 
On the contrary, it only determines the measure of how well the conversion results correspond to the structure of the original dataset. 
It does not tyr to find the optimal transformation of the original data; instead, it searches for another dataset of lower dimensions with a structrure that's as close to the original one as possible.
