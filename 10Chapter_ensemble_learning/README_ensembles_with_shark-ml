There is only one ensemble learning algorithm in the Shark-ML library, which is the random forest, and it can be trained only for solving classification task. 
So, far this set of samples, we will use the Brest Cancer Wisconsin (Diangostic) data set loacted at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic). 
It is taken from Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019) UCI Machine Learning Respository, Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml. 

There are 569 instances in this dataset, and each instance has 32 attributes: the ID, the diagnosis, and 30 real value input features. 
The diagnosis can have two values: 
	1) M = malignant
	
	2) B = benign. 

Other attributes have 10 real-value features computed for each cell nuclues as follows: 

	1) Radius (mean distances from the center to the perimeter)

	2) Texture (standard deviation of grayscale values)

	3) Perimeter

	4) Area 

	5) Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

	6) Compactness 

	7) Concavity (serverity of concave portions of the contour)

	8) symmetry 

	9) Factal dimension (coastline approximation - 1)

This dataset can be used for a binary classification task.
