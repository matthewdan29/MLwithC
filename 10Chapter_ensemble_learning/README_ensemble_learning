Anyone who works with data analysis and machine learning will come to understand that no method is ideal or universal. 
This is why there are so many methods.
Researchers have been searching for years for a compromise between the accuracy, simplicity, and interpretablity of various models. 
Moreover, how can we increase the accuracy of the model, perferably without changing its essence?
One way to improve the accuracy of models is to create and train model ensembles -- that is, set of models used to solve the same problem. 
The ensemble traingin methodlogy is the training of a final set of simple classifiers, with the subsequent merging of the results of their predicitons into a single forcast of the aggregated algorithm.
