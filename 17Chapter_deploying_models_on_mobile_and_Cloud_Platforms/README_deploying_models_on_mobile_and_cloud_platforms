This dir is going to go over deploying machine learning models on modile devices running on both the Android operating system and the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

Using C++ on mobile devices allows us to  make programs faster and more compact. 
We can untilize as many computational resources as possible because modern compilers can optimize the program concerning the target CPU architecture. 
C++ doesn't use an additional garbage collector for memeory management, which can have a sigificant impact on program perfformance. 
Program size can be reduced because C++ desn't use an additional VM and is compiled directly to machine code.
These facts make C++ the right choice for mobile devices with a limited amount of resources and can be used to solve heavy computational task.

Using C++ to implenment machine learning models that are used for the cloud can provide other benefits. 
As we mentioned previously, you can increase application performance by compiling a program for your specific architecture; usually, this plays a significant role in the data preprocessing step. 
THe starting time is also much shorter for a native application than for interpretable programs. 
This fact can make your application more responsive if you're using cloud machines that are only launched by client requests. 
These types of machines are used for reducing the cloud service's cost.
