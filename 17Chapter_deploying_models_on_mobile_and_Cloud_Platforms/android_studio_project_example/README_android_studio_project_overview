We will be using Android Studio IDE to create our mobile application. 
The "cpp" folder contains the C++ part of the whole project. 
In the project, the Android Studio IDE created the C++ part as a native shared library project that had been configured with the CMake build generation system. 
The "java" folder contains the Java part of the project. 
In our case, it is a single file that defines the main activity -- the object that's used as a connection between the UI elements and event handlers. 
The "res" folder contains project resources, such as UI elements and strings definitions. 

We also need to create the "jniLibs" folder under the "main" folder, with the following structure (pic 17.1)

Android studio requires ust ot place additional native libraries in such folders to correctly package them into the final application. 
It also allows the JNI system to be able to find these libraries. 
Notice that we placed PyTorch libraries in the "armeabi-v7a" folder because they have only been compiled for this CPU architecture. 
If you have libraries for other architectures, you have to create folders with corresponding names. 

The IDE uses the Gradle build system to project configuration, so there are two files named "build.gradle", which contains the main settings, and "local.properties", which contains user-degined values.
