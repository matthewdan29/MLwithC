The project, it has a button that we can use to launch a native camera application to take a photo, a text view to show image classification descriptions, and an image view to show the photo. 
We should define these UI elements in the "activity_main.xml" file of the project.

Next, we should also define the text captions for the UI elements in the "strings.xml" file, which you can find the "res" folder. 

Now that the UI elements have been defined, we can connect them to event handlers in the "MainActivity" class to make our application respond to users' actions.
