The client part of our server can be implemented in different languages and with different technologies that support the HTTP protocol. 
THe most stragitforward implementation of the client application can be written with HTML and Javascript. We can use such a client with any modern browser. 

There will be two files in our client application. The first one will be the "index.html" file, which should contain the definition of a simple web page with a form for uploading files.

The second file is a JavaScript implementation of the HTML form event handler. which "upload.js" file.
