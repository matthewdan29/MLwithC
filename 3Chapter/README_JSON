JSON file format uses name-vale pair (namespaces) and array of such pairs. 
It has rules on how to group such pairs to distinct objects and array declarations, and there are rules on how to define values of different types. 
Below is a example of JSON format 

{
	name: "Bill", 
	age: 25, 
	phones:
	[
		{
			type: "home"
			number: 435343490
		}, 
		{
			type: "work"
			number: 56985468
		}
	]
}

The advantages of this format are human readability, software support and many computer platforms, and the possiblility to store hierarchial and nested data structures. 
Disadvatages are its slow parsing speed in comparison with binary formats, and the fact it is not very useful for representing numerical matrices.
