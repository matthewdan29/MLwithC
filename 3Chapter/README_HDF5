HDF5 is a specialied file format for storing scientific data.
This file format was developed to store heterogeneous multidimensional data with a complex structure. 
It provides fast access to single elements because it has optimized data structures for using secondary storage. 
HDF5 supports data compression. 
This file format consists of named groups that contain multidimensional arrays of mutitype data. 
Each element of this file format can contain metadtat

HDF5 
The adavatages of this format are its high read and write speed, fast access to distinct elements, and its ability to support data with a complex structure and various types of data. 
Disadvantages are the requirement of specialized tools for editing and viewing by users, the limited support of type conversions among different platforms, and using a single file for the wole dataset. 
The last issue makes data restoration almost impossible in the event of file cuorruption.
