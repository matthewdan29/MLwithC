Sometimes, we need to transform data stored in one format to another to satisfy our needs. 

	1) Increasing human readability to ease communication with engineers. 

	2) The existence of compression possibility to allow data to occupy less space on secondary storage. 

	3) The use of data in the bbinary form to speed up the parsing process

	4) Supporting the complex relations between different parts of data to make precise mirroring of a specific domain. 

	5) Platform independence to be able to use the dataset in different development and production environments. 

			Some common forms of file/data 

	1) JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (namespace technology is very important in cloud computing and sending resources between computes for processing data to network load balancing)

	2) Comma-Separated Values (CSV) (think of databases and excel spread sheets)

	3) Hierarchical Data Format v5 (HDF5) (non rational databases)
